Not my first try at Minecraft modding, but the first one with a github rep.
Oh please, go easy on me the god of minecraft modding.
Project includes some sprites for items, blocks etc.
The goal of the project is to:
- Learn Java
- Learn the basics of MM
- Make the following features:
*The whole theme of the mod is these stones that one can make a potion from. The potion makes you invoulnarable to damage for a few seconds, but with a twist.
The so-called shield from the potion brakes when hit a spefic amount of times. The amout is determined by the level of the potion. Basicly, only quantity matters if
you want to break the 'defence' of the potion.*
